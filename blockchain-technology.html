            <h3>Cyber Security Tools</h3>
                <p>The increased reliance on digital technologies and the pervasiveness of cyber threats have made cybersecurity more and more important.
                  Cybersecurity is crucial due to the increasing amount of data, regulatory requirements, IoT and interconnected networks, supply chain risks, business continuity, and digital transformation. Effective cybersecurity measures are essential for preserving important assets, maintaining trust, and mitigating the potential impacts of cyber threats on individuals, organizations (and their communities). Let’s see some of the important tools used in Cyber security:-</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Firewalls: Firewalls serve as a partition separating internal networks from external networks (like the Internet). They keep an eye on and manage incoming and outgoing network traffic in accordance with pre-established security rules. The use of hardware- or software-based firewalls can help stop network attacks, unauthorized access, and data breaches.
